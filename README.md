📊 About the Project
This project provides an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of student performance data. By leveraging powerful Python libraries, we aim to:

Identify key factors affecting student outcomes.
Highlight correlations between study hours, parental education, and grades.
Provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers.
🔍 Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Statistical analysis to uncover key trends.
Interactive and static visualizations (bar plots, heatmaps, etc.).
Automated scripts for reusable analysis.
